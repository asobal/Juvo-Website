            <p>Competitive swimmers who are blind are often notified of the end of the lane by a person physically tapping
                them with a foam stick. While this method has long been accepted, it requires constant assistance and removes
                independence from the athlete. <br> <br>Athletes should not need to rely on physical contact or constant 
                supervision to participate safely and confidently in their sport. Our team set out to design a solution 
                that respects the athlete first while addressing a real and persistent accessibility gap in competitive 
                swimming.

            <p>We developed an assistive lane-end notification system that provides swimmers who are blind with a clear auditory signal as they approach the wall. Instead of physical tapping, the swimmer receives a sound through Bluetooth earbuds, allowing them to maintain focus, control, and independence. </p>
            <p>This system was designed with affordability, ease of use, and dignity at its core. It supports swimmers in both training and competition environments and reduces the need for additional personnel on deck.</p>

                    real time. Using on-device processing through a Raspberry Pi, the system tracks 
                    the swimmer’s position within the lane.</p>
